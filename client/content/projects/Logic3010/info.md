# About
A high-fidelity prototype for a web-app redesign of the software [Logic 2010](https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/) used in **PHLB50: Introduction to Symbolic Logic**. This was done as the group project for **CSCC10: Human-Computer Interaction**. Concepts learned throughout the course were used to create, develop and build up to the completion of a high-fidelity prototype of the redesign. Data was gathered from a diverse pool of subjects using a variety of different methods including questionaires, interviews and guided study groups. Using common HCI guidlines such as Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [5 Usability Components](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/), multiple improvements were researched and gathered together to form the high-fidelity prototype.
