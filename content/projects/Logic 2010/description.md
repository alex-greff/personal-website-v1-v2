# Background

The group project for **CSCC10: Human-Computer Interaction**, redesigning the **PHLB50: Introduction to Symbolic Logic** course's software, [Logic 2010](https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/). Concepts learned throughout the course were used to create develop and build up to the completion of a high-fidelity prototype of the redesign. Data was gathered from a diverse pool of subjects using a variety of different methods including questionaires, interviews and guided study groups. Using common HCI guidlines such as [Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [5 Usability Components](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/) multiple improvements were reasearched and gathered together to form the high-fidelity prototype.
