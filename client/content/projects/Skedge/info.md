# About

A **visual timetable planning tool** for UofT students. The project aims to fill the gap left by the far-from-sufficient timetable planning tools provided by UofT as well as bringing new and unique features and improvements.

I am the lead designer and front-end developer of the project with the responsibility of working closely with the other team members to integrate it successfully into our microservice-oriented backend platform. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is being used for design prototypes and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as the frontend framework.
