Hi my name is **Alexander Greff**. 

I am currently a student studying computer science at the **University of Toronto: Scarborough**. 

Ever since I was a child I have enjoyed 4 things: learning, solving problems, building things and being creative. 

Computer science gives me a place to do all of these things at once hence why I have chosen to study this field with such a passion. 

On this website you will see some of the projects that I have done in the past as well as my work experience within the field itself. 

I also enjoy producing various forms of **Electronic Dance Music (EDM)** in my spare time when not working on other computer science-related projects and have included a [page](music) dedicated to some of the tracks that I have made in the past. 

Please feel free to check them out and let me know what you think. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to [contact me](contact).
